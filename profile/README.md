## Digital History at Clemson

This repository houses student and faculty work in Digital History at Clemson University. 

Clemson is home to the nation's first Digital History Ph.D. program. Todayâ€™s historians will have to rely increasingly on new analytical techniques to sift through and make sense of large amounts of data. Digital history utilizes computer technology to develop and investigate historical research questions. It allows historians to conduct textual, spatial, and network analyses, and to visualize these results over time and space. Over the past half-century, scholars studying all time periods have made use of new technological advancements to interrogate primary sources and reconsider historical interpretations. As the prevalence of born-digital sources increases, technological fluency will be an even more important part of conducting historical research. Historians must know how to critique and understand the inherent biases built into algorithms, digital archives and various technologies.
